## Invocations

* is [trail] open?
* is [trail] closed?
* can i ride [trail]?
* what is the status of [trail]?
* etc.

* etc.

### List open trails

You can list open trails with

* list trails that are open.

* etc.

### Ask for a trail to ride

You can ask for a random trail recommendation from the list of
open trails with

* where should i ride?
* tell me what to ride.
* what trail should i ride?
* etc.

## Caveats
For trails with multiple parts, e.g. cnf and san lee, you must say the 
full name of trail, e.g. "cnf school", you cannot just say "cnf".  
("cnf school", "carolina north school", and "carolina north forest school" 
will all resolve, however).
